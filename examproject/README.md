# Exam analysis project

Our project is titled *Exam Project* and answers the problem 1, 2 and 3 given in the Exam 2024. Problem 1 is analysing a production econoomy and CO2 taxtion. Problem 2 is analysing a Career choice model and lastly problem 3 is analysing Barycentric interpolation. 

Comment: For problem 2 and 3, two classes has been made: CareerChoices and BarycentricInterpolation. However, when running the code and importing the classes from exam_2024_Karo.py, we experience technical issues. Instead of using the classes within the .py file, we have inserted the classes directly into the Jupyter Notebook ny_exam_2024_Karo.ipynb, such that every question is running. 

The results of the project can be seen from running [ny_exam_2024_Karo.ipynb](examproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

The project is written and solved by Anna Stenild (Bcd934), Karoline Marie Meulengracht (Bhj883) and Tenna Merrald (Khc600)
