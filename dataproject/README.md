# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **The Effect of a Positive Shock to Technology in High- and Low-Income Countries* which examines the impact of a technological change in both high- and low-income countries.

The results of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply simulated data from Denmark, United States, India and China. The data has been extracted from Penn World Table 9.0 and The World Bank, and have later been simulated from 1960-2100. This means that only the values in 1960 are actual values which are not simulated. The whole dataset have been used in a previous bachelor's thesis (author: Karoline M. Meulengracht), where the data has been used in a Green Solow Model and thus simulated. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations: 

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy: For numerical computing
matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
ipywidgets: For creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks
IPython: For enhanced interactive Python, including widgets and other display functionalities

The project is written and solved by Anna Stenild (Bcd934), Karoline Marie Meulengracht (Bhj883) and Tenna Merrald (Khc600)
